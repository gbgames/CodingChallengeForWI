Below is a small coding challenge we would like you to solve.  We tried to leave most of the implementation details for these problems up to you, so feel free to send questions if you need clarification on anything.

        Description
            Given a list of people with their birth and end years (all between 1900 and 2000), find the year with the most number of people alive.
        Code
            Solve using a language of your choice and dataset of your own creation.
        Submission
            Please upload your code, dataset, and example of the programâ€™s output to Bit Bucket or Github. Please include any graphs or charts created by your program.
